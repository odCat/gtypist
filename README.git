Notes on how to build it from git
=================================


You can obtain the source code for gtypist from git like this:

  $ git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/gtypist.git


REQUIREMENTS
------------

Below is a list of software required to build GNU Typist along with
suggested version numbers.  The version are not required, and older
software versions may work.  But we know that gtypist can be built
with the software versions specified so, if you run in to problems
building gtypist, you may want to ensure that your build environment
is up-to-date.

Software required to build gtypist (older versions may work):
    * automake 1.11.1
    * autoconf 2.67
    * GCC 4.4.5
        * and libc headers
    * GNU make 3.81
    * ncursesw 5.7 (with wide-character support)
        * and headers
    * help2man 1.38.2
    * gettext 0.18.1.1
    * makeinfo
    * gawk (awk won't do)
    * autopoint
    * libiconv (included in glibc)
    * gengetopt 2.23

The following should be the required package names for Debian
(testing/wheezy):

  automake autoconf autopoint build-essential libncursesw5-dev
  help2man gettext texinfo gawk gengetopt.

  (Ubuntu package names should be similar).


BUILDING
--------

In short, you can build gtypist like this:

  $ ./autogen.sh

You can pass options to 'autogen.sh' in the same way as you would pass
them to the configuration script.  Unfortunately, to get the entire
list of available options that you can use, you have to invoke
'./configure --help', and since autogen.sh creates the configure
script, this is not possible initially.  If you need to generate the
configure script before running 'autogen.sh', you can run 'aclocal;
automake --add-missing; autoconf'.  You can also set $CC, $CFLAGS and
$LDFLAGS to desired values, if you wish.

If you are unsure about passing options to the configure script, don't
worry -- the default options are usually what people want.  A common
exception to this, though, is where you don't have root access and you
can not install gtypist system-wide.  To install elsewhere, supply the
'--prefix=[DIR]' option when calling 'autogen.sh' (where [DIR] is the
directory in which you want to install gtypist). E.g., you may want to
run 'autogen.sh' like this:

  $ ./autogen.sh --prefix="$HOME"

When you run 'autogen.sh' you should examine its output for possible
errors.  Since this is a development version, it may even not build
correctly.  Whether you believe that you have done everything right or
not, you can email a description of your problem to the bug-gtypist
mailing list <bug-gtypist@gnu.org> and ask for help.


BUILDING on Windows
-------------------

Note that if you are building on Windows, you must still first run
autogen.sh in a GNU/Linux environment, as described above, and then
unpack the resulting .tar.gz in the Windows environment. Running
autogen.sh under Windows is not supported (you can try it if you
really want to, but we haven't!).


INSTALLATION
------------

To install gtypist, go:

  $ make install

But you may need to be root to do this. Alternatively, if you have
permission to use sudo, you might want to go:

  $ sudo make install

If you do not have root access (or permission to use sudo) to install
gtypist system-wide, you may need to supply a '--prefix=[DIR]' option
to the configure script.  See the section on building gtypist (above)
for more information.


UNINSTALLATION
--------------

If you still have the same sources with the same configuration
settings, you can simply `make uninstall' (you may need to be root, or
use 'sudo').  If not, and if you have not used a '--prefix' option
with the configure script, then you should find gtypist installed in
/usr/local where you can delete the files manually.
