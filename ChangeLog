	  otherwise.
	* configur.bat.in: Added support for building via MinGW.  Updated DJGPP
	  Makefile since source files are now in the "src" folder.
	  (NOTE: This batch file may not work on DOS or Win9x, since it uses
	  "set /p" which is a Windows NT-specific command.)
	* TODO: Removed one completed item, added one user idea.

2008-05-02  Paul Goins  <general@vultaire.net>

	* AUTHORS: Added "GNU Typist Development Team"

	* version.sh:	bugfix release:  2.7.2.

2004-08-23  Dmitry Rutsky <rutsky@school.ioffe.rssi.ru>

	* configure.in:  fixed stupid error in that check.

2004-06-26  Dmitry Rutsky <rutsky@school.ioffe.rssi.ru>

	* configure.in:  added checks for [n]curses libraries header files,
	  only select curses or ncurses if corresponding header is found.
	* autogen.sh:  didn't write version info in INSTALL file, fixed that.
	* INSTALL.in:  slightly edited unix installation section;  tell that
	  not only [n]curses library but its header files are required.

2004-02-26  Michael Opdenacker <michaelo@gnu.org>

	* Makefile.am: now requires automake 1.8.2

2004-02-23  Dmitry Rutsky <rutsky@school.ioffe.rssi.ru>

	* README:  removed repeated or redundant lines in `Files' section,
	  changed the section's name to probably more appropriate.

2003-11-23  Dmitry Rutsky <rutsky@school.ioffe.rssi.ru>

	* tools/typcombine:  removed `ktlecten.typ' from the `More lessons...'
	  screen.
	* src/gtypist.c:  minor cleanups, fixed incorrect handling of
	  80-characters long lines in drills.

2003-11-16  Dmitry Rutsky <rutsky@school.ioffe.rssi.ru>

	* autogen.sh:  use `autopoint' instead of `gettextize'.
	* configure.in, Makefile.am:  permanently added the gettext stuff,
	  removed "don't commit" warnings (the files will no longer be changed
	  in the build process).
	* m4/Makefile.am:  added.

2003-11-01  Dmitry Rutsky <rutsky@school.ioffe.rssi.ru>

	* TODO:  documented "unchanging banners" bug.
	* lessons/ru.typ:  minor improvements.

2003-10-31  Dmitry Rutsky <rutsky@school.ioffe.rssi.ru>

	* version.sh, autogen.sh, configure.in:  a better handling of version
	  definition.  Changed AC_INIT macro to handle current AC_INIT
	  semantics.
	* Makefile.am:  added `intl' to SUBDIRS to fix broken distribution.
	* lessons/ru.typ:  `#! /' typo was fixed.
	* src/cursmenu.c:  up-label, if present, now works as described in
	  the manual.  Most of the problems with ESCAPE key handling were
	  fixed.  Error messages in case of a nonexistent label will no
	  longer contain irrelevant script lines...
	* TODO:  ...nonetheless the line number is still irrelevant.

2003-10-26  Hynek Hanke  <hanke@volny.cz>

	* autogen.sh (gettexth): Added a search for gettext.h in /usr/ as
	Dmitry suggested.
	* po/cs.po: Updated.

2003-10-25  Hynek Hanke  <hanke@volny.cz>

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): gtypist.1 corrected to src/gtypist.1
	* configure.in: Added missing target Makefile.in
	* autogen.sh (gettexth): Copy gettext to src/

2003-10-25  Hynek Hanke  <hanke@volny.cz>

	* po/POTFILES.in: Updated to reflect that the sources are now in src/
	* configure.in: Build also src/Makefile.am
	* Makefile.am: Some stuff moved to src/Makefile.am
	Added src/ to subdirectories.

	* All .c and .h sources moved to a new directory src/.

2003-10-25  Hynek Hanke  <hanke@volny.cz>

	* autogen.sh: Don't try to build documentation itself. It's generated
	now by regular auto-tools mechanism. See doc/Makefile.am.

2003-10-24  Hynek Hanke  <hanke@volny.cz>

	* autogen.sh (automake --add-missing): Added test on failure of this
	command, so that it doesn't cause obscure problem later.

2003-10-03  Michael Opdenacker <michaelo@gnu.org>

	* typefortune: Ben Armstrong fixed the '-s' and '-n' options

2003-09-28  Michael Opdenacker <michaelo@gnu.org>

        * cursmenu.c, error.c, gtypist.c, script.c:
          Added #define _(String) gettext (String)
          so that we don't have to hack gettext.h and make it non standard.
	* autogen.sh: now copyies gettext.h from its install.
	* gettext.h: removed from CVS
	* configure.in: Should now work when both ncurses and curses
          are installed, on GNU/Solaris for example.
	* QUESTIONS: renaming of the StandardQuestions file. Now
	  distributed in the source package.
	* TODO: updated. All developers should write their ideas in this file.

2003-08-28  Rob Leslie  <rob@mars.org>

	* gtypist.c: Added support to resync with the typist after an
	  error.  If the typist presses the correct key after an error, it
	  is ignored (sync behind).  If the typist misses a key, it is
	  flagged as an error but the key is credited to the next
	  character so the typist can continue without stopping (sync
	  ahead).

2003-08-24  Dmitry Rutsky <rutsky@school.ioffe.rssi.ru>

	* cursmenu.c:  a better handling of `left' and `right' keys in the
	  menus, don't go offscreen on the keys if there is a large
	  single-column list (as in lessons/ttde.typ).

2003-08-03  Dmitry Rutsky <rutsky@school.ioffe.rssi.ru>

	* lessons/ru.typ:  new Russian cyrillic keyboard course.
	* po/ru.po, configure.in:  new Russian localization.
	* tools/typcombine:  tell about new course in "More lessons..."
	* *.[ch]:  corrected "gtypist-bug" to "bug-gtypist" in addresses.
	* gtypist.c:  #include <locale.h>, internationalization didn't worked
	  without it (LC_ALL was not #defined);  type of YN and RNE strings
	  changed to `unsigned char' (comparisons with them if they were
	  characters with 8th bit set didn't work correctly).
	* lessons/Makefile.am:  include ru.typ in the distribution, as well as
	  cs.typ.

2003-07-19  Dmitry Rutsky <rutsky@school.ioffe.rssi.ru>

	* configure.in:  removed Makefiles automagically added there by
	  gettextize (yes, that was my mistake in 2003-07-01).  Added note
	  that this file will be changed by gettextize.
	* autogen.sh:  don't run gettextize if the sources were gettextized
	  already.
	* Makefile.am:  added headers to gtypist_SOURCES back (yes, that was
	  my mistake too), removed some duplicates of what gettextize
	  added there.  Added note regarding gettextize.
	* cursmenu.c:  'q' now works as ESCAPE in the menus.
	* *.[ch] except getopt*.[ch]:  added/corrected legal attributes.
	* gtypist.c, script.c:  exit in case user got to particular excersize
	  with -l and tried to exit using `E'.

2003-07-04  Dmitry Rutsky <rutsky@school.ioffe.rssi.ru>

	* cursmenu.c:  "Up/Exit" label code was commented out,
	  since ESCAPE key works, we don't need these items.
	* gtypist.[ch], cusmenu.c:  support for colors in the top banner.
	  New gtypist.h header for convenience.  New --banner-colours option to
	  select the banner colours.
	* script.c:  now we ignore empty lines with some whitespaces rather
	  than exit with "data shortage".
	* gtypist.c, cursmenu.c, script.c:  fixed segfault which occured when
	  the first thing in the script was not a menu.  There actually was
	  a bunch of problems, it seems that now they are fixed.

2003-07-03  Dmitry Rutsky <rutsky@school.ioffe.rssi.ru>

	* error.[ch], gtypist.c, cursmenu.c:  some cleanups.
	* gtypist.c:  new option `--always-sure' was added to suppress stupid
	  confirmations.  Bottom-line messages was tweaked a little to improve
	  appearance (spaces at the edges), "Press Return..." now works as
	  "Press RETURN or SPACE to continue, ESC to return to the menu".
	* cursmenu.c:  add '\x0A' for working RETURN key in DOS build.

2003-07-02  Dmitry Rutsky <rutsky@school.ioffe.rssi.ru>

	* curmenu.c: Now we do not erase the banner,
	  display the menu header centered above the menu,
	  and even print some menu motion help at the bottom.
	  Also now you can move around the menu with arrowed (or vi) keys in
	  any desired possible direction, it is very useful in multi-column
	  menus.

2003-07-01  Dmitry Rutsky <rutsky@school.ioffe.rssi.ru>

	* autogen.sh:  check autoconf exit status and display useful
	  information if it has failed rather than just go on and get
	  more failures.
	* configure.in:  duplicate intl/Makefile, po/Makefile.in
	  and po/Makefile have been removed, autoconf no longer fails
	  to build because of that.
	* README.CVS now can aid building the sources from CVS by unexperienced
	  (for me it was a great pain).
	* autogen.sh:  redundant `rm -f config.cache' has been removed
	  (it have no effect with modern autoconf).
	* cursmenu.c:  missing standard #includes were added, the code was
	  corrected a little to eliminate the compiler warnings (what
	  the meaning of do_menu return value was intended to be?).
	* script.c, error.c:  missing standard includes were added, all of the
	  compiler warnings were suppressed.
	* Makefile.am:  excluded headers from GTYPIST_sources, they are not
	  separately compiled and get into dependencies automatically.
	* configur.bat.in:  really include new modules (see the ChangeLog
	  record of 2003-04-06;  BTW autogen warns about it).
	* cursmenu.c:  '\n' was supplemented by KEY_ENTER
	  (without it in the DOS build it was impossible
	  to select any menu item, and even exit the program);  new
	  aliases for the control keys:  KEY_RIGHT for KEY_ENTER; 'K' and
	  'J' for KEY_UP and KEY_DOWN respectively (now you can write in the
	  documentation that gtypist supports vi keys in menu control ;-) ).
	* Some hacks to enable the `E' key in "exit the lesson" queries again,
	  it seems to work.
	* cursmenu.c:  added working "go back" key in the menu that completes
	  the basical navigation code:  'Esc' or 'H' will get you to the
	  previous menu where you've been, or out of the program if it is
	  toplevel menu.
	* gtypist.c:  quick hack to get rid of annoying Escape key delays in
	  the ncurses library.
	* script.c:  made it to print "Happy Typing!" at exit rather than just
	  clear the screen :-)

2003-06-08  Felix Natter  <fnatter@gmx.net>

	* cursmenu.c (do_menu): fix a bug when scrolling with many columns
	and items (new variable `real_items_per_column' replaces
	`items_first_column')
	* compute `columns' with a spacing of 2 so that we're sure that
	menu-item descriptions don't clash

2003-05-02  Michael Opdenacker <michaelo@gnu.org>

	* po/zh_TW: New Traditional Chinese translation
	from OLS3 <ols3@www.tnc.edu.tw>\

2003-04-13  Hynek Hanke <hanke@volny.cz>

	* lessons/cs.typ: use M instead of K for menus
	* po/cs.po: new messages translated
	* doc/gtypist.cs.texi: updated

2003-04-06  Felix Natter  <fnatter@gmx.net>

2003-03-11  Michael Opdenacker <michaelo@gnu.org>

	* script.c: updated with patch from Martin Pitt <martin@piware.de>
	to ignore trailing spaces in lesson file lines.

2003-03-01  Felix Natter  <fnatter@gmx.net>

	* doc/gtypist.texi (Supplied lessons): update the section on kt*.typ

	* cursmenu.c (do_menu): handle PAGE UP/PAGE DOWN

2003-02-02  Felix Natter  <fnatter@gmx.net>

	* added/updated lessons: ttde.typ ktde.typ ktdk2.typ kten.typ
	ktfr2.typ ktnumber.typ ktdk.typ ktdvorak.typ ktfr.typ ktno.typ
	+ remove ktlecten.typ
	(from tipptrainer 0.4, kdeedu-3.1/ktouch)

	* lessons/gtypist.pm: generate M:

	* cursmenu.c (do_menu): run get_script_line

2003-01-13  Felix Natter  <fnatter@gmx.net>

	* split code into modules (script, curses-menu, error, main)
	+ hook up menu-code (do_menu, M: command)

2003-01-12  Felix Natter  <fnatter@gmx.net>

	* apply patch from Steven Elliott (elliott4@austin.rr.com):
	"I've attached a small patch that allows gtypist to display errors
	in reverse video instead of the reverse video '^' as it currently does"
	(option --show-errors)

2002-12-10  Michael Opdenacker <michaelo@gnu.org>

	* configure.in: removed intl/Makefile, po/Makefile and m4/Makefile
	from AC_OUTPUT because already added by gettextize (unavoidable).

2002-12-10  Michael Opdenacker <michaelo@gnu.org>

	* typefortune: several fixes from Stefan Troeger <stefan@troeger.st>:
	  improved 'fortune' detection and temporary file deletion.

2002-11-26  Michael Opdenacker <michaelo@gnu.org>

	* po/nl.po: new Dutch interface from J.M. Cogels <jcogels@chello.nl>

2002-10-28  Michael Opdenacker <michaelo@gnu.org>

	* configure.in: replaced 'dnl' by '#',
	removed duplicate entries in AC_OUTPUT.

2002-09-21  Felix Natter  <fnatter@gmx.net>

	* autogen.sh: exit if gawk isn't installed

2002-09-15  Felix Natter  <fnatter@gmx.net>

	* typefortune: allow (E)xit: have to add a *:END label
	and K:12:END at the beginning

2002-09-14  Felix Natter  <fnatter@gmx.net>

	* configure.in: Christian Weisgerber <naddy@mips.inka.de>:
	fix a bug in configure.in: AC_CHECK_LIB doesn't call
	AC_DEFINE so now we do it explicitly:
	AC_CHECK_LIB(curses, wbkgdset,
	  [AC_DEFINE(HAVE_LIBCURSES, 1, [Is curses available])
	    LIBS="-lcurses $LIBS"])

2002-06-28  Hynek Hanke  <hanke@volny.cz>

	* findwords.sh: New script to help with creating lessons.

2002-05-20  Felix Natter  <fnatter@gmx.net>

	* gtypist.c: do the same as last item for headers

2002-05-18  Felix Natter  <fnatter@gmx.net>

	* configure.in: check for ncurses if curses is not available
	(but use 2x AC_CHECK_LIB instead of AC_SEARCH_LIBS to support Solaris)

2002-04-25  Michael Opdenacker <michaelo@gnu.org>

	* Replaced `cz' by `cs' in all file names.
	* *.po: Updated with the msgmerged files; updated the version
	  and package name, as well as the copyright notices.

2002-04-22  Michael Opdenacker <michaelo@gnu.org>

	* gtypist.c, Makefile.am: for consistency with 'PACKAGE_LOCALE_DIR'
	  replaced by `LOCALEDIR', replaced `PACKAGE_DATA_DIR' by `DATADIR'.
	* autogen.sh: now checks that texinfo is installed.
	  Runs `make' (to generate `doc/version.texi') and generates
	  the html manuals.

2002-04-18  Michael Opdenacker <michaelo@gnu.org>

	* gtypist.c: replaced '1998-2001' by `1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002'
	  in the copyright notices (following GNU guidelines).
	* autogen.sh: made `help2man' mandatory for building sources.
	* configure.in: suppressed the check for help2man, as the manual
	  is now always created in the sources.
        * doc/fdl.texi: temporary hack of the original file, so that building
	  works (to be fixed very soon).

2002-04-16  Michael Opdenacker <michaelo@gnu.org>

	* po/: new Makevars file as recommended by gettextize.
	* Makefile.am: replaced 'INCLUDES' (deprecated) by 'AM_CPPFLAGS'
	* acconfig.h: removed because deprecated.
	  Replaced by the use of `-D' in AM_CPPFLAGS (see below).
	* configure.in: only kept AM_GNU_GETTEXT for i18n.
	  --nointl and --with-nointl options are no longer available,
	  but --disable-nls in still available.
	* Makefile.am: added a new AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS variable
	  set to '1.6 dist-bzip2 check-news' (see automake manual).
	* Other changes: to be documented very soon!
	* gtypist.c: Replaced PACKAGE_LOCALE_DIR by LOCALE_DIR:
          more standard: found in gettext doc and used by several packages.
	* Makefile.am: Added '-DLOCALEDIR=\"$(datadir)/locale\"'
          to AM_CPPFLAGS (replaces PACKAGE_LOCAL_DIR defined in acconfig.h)

2002-04-08  Felix Natter  <fnatter@gmx.net>

	* gtypist.c (do_keybind): omit "%d%s"

2002-04-07  Michael Opdenacker <michaelo@gnu.org>

	* Added new Czech interface messages.

2002-04-07  Felix Natter  <fnatter@gmx.net>

	* gtypist.c (fatal_error): write "\n" if line==NULL
	(so that there is always a '\n' at the end of the error-message)

2002-04-05  Felix Natter  <fnatter@gmx.net>

	* gtypist.c: add /* xgettext: no-c-format */ comments so that
	xgettext does not think that '%' is part of a format-string
	(suggested by Bruno Haible)

2002-03-31  Felix Natter  <fnatter@gmx.net>

	* Makefile.am: add typefortune.1

2002-03-17  Felix Natter  <fnatter@gmx.net>

	* run gettextize from gettext 0.11.1
	* create po/Makevars
	* run aclocal with "-I m4" in autogen.sh

2002-03-14  Michael Opdenacker <michaelo@gnu.org>

	* autogen.sh: automake-1.6, autoconf 2.53, gettext-0.11 recommended;
        fixed links to their sources.
        Added --intl option to gettextize in autogen.sh

2002-03-10  Felix Natter  <fnatter@gmx.net>

	* fix a bug: -k wasn't mentioned in getopt (don't know why !)

2002-03-09  Felix Natter  <fnatter@gmx.net>

	* add new script `typefortune', as suggested and started by
	Yuusuke Mita <neiklotrrj@yahoo.com>

2002-01-14  Michael Opdenacker <michaelo@gnu.org>

	* configure.in: suppressed "ncurses" in AC_SEARCH_LIBS, and kept
	only "curses". This is enough because ncurses installs provide
	all the files expected for curses. This caused problems in platforms
	such as GNU/Solaris where both curses and ncurses are installed.
        gcc was compiling for curses, but ld was given ¨-l ncurses¨,
        which resulted in undefined symbols.
       * fr.po, es.po, fi.po: fixed alignment problems with raw speed,
	adjusted speed and error rate display.

2001-12-10  Felix Natter  <fnatter@gmx.net>

	* change CONFIRM_EXIT_MSG to include "[Y/N]"
	* do_query_repeat: add 2nd parameter which indicates whether
	"Next" is an option
	* do_drill, do_speedtest: don't display a message saying
	"Sorry, you can't skip this lesson". Instead, just don't make
	"Next" be an option in the following call to do_query_repeat
	* rename CONFIRM_EXIT_MSG to CONFIRM_EXIT_LESSON_MSG
	because it isn't used to exit the program

2001-12-09  Felix Natter  <fnatter@gmx.net>

	* main: change REPEAT_NEXT_EXIT_MSG (longer)

2001-12-08  Felix Natter  <fnatter@gmx.net>

	* do_query_repeat: call do_query_simple(CONFIRM_EXIT_MSG) to let the
	user confirm (E)xit
	* do_query_simple: new function
	* wait_user: don't check for Fkeys. you can now quit a lesson
	by pressing 'E' in REPEAT_NEXT_EXIT_MSG
	* print_help,...: rename --wpmode to --word-processor
	(as suggested by Michael); rename variable to cl_wpemu
	* new variable cl_no_skip from option --no-skip, no message NO_SKIP_MSG
	* do_query_noscriptfile: remove
	* do_query: remove hack which was used in do_query_noscriptfile
	* do_query_repeat: new query which prompts for repeat/next/exit
	(new i18n string "R/N/E")
	* do_drill, do_speedtest: use do_query_repeat instead
	of do_query_noscriptfile for WANNA_REPEAT_MSG
	* main: add translatable strings RNE and change WANNA_REPEAT_MSG
	to "R to repeat, N for next or E to exit" (now called
	REPEAT_NEXT_EXIT_MSG)

2001-11-29  Felix Natter  <fnatter@gmx.net>

	* gtypist.c (do_drill, do_speedtest): allow ESC ESC to be used for
	skipping a lesson (ESC in the middle of an exercise restarts it and
	ESC at the start of a lesson skips it)
	(as suggested by Ben Armstrong <synrg@sanctuary.nslug.ns.ca>)

2001-10-08  Michael Opdenacker  <michaelo@gnu.org>

	* Added missing checks in configure.in reported by autoscan.
	* Removed useless stuff in acconfig.h. Only kept PACKAGE_LOCALE_DIR.

2001-09-24  Michael Opdenacker  <michaelo@gnu.org>

	* Added configur.bat.in, autogen.sh, INSTALL.in
	and TODO to EXTRA_DIST

2001-09-18  Felix Natter  <fnatter@gmx.net>

	* gtypist.c (do_speedtest): fix problem: give up via ESC wasn't
	possible in speed-tests. I fixed this by inserting
        if ( c == ASCII_ESC ) break;
	in do_speedtest simply because it's done in do_drill as well.
	this fixes the problem but do_drill and do_speedtest need to be
	rethought some day.

2001-09-13  Felix Natter  <fnatter@gmx.net>

	* configure.in (ALL_LINGUAS): add fi.po (finnish by
	kusti@iki.fi (Kimmo K. I. Surakka))

2001-09-07  Felix Natter  <fnatter@gmx.net>

	* gtypist.c: add macro ASCII_ENTER which is used in wait_user_input
	(necessary because pdcurs-2.4 returns 0x0D for Enter if raw() is used)
	* gtypist.c (do_drill, do_speedtest): translate 0x0D (DOS newline)
	to ASCII_NL
	(necessary because pdcurs-2.4 returns 0x0D for Enter if raw() is used)

2001-09-05  Felix Natter  <fnatter@gmx.net>

	* gtypist.c (do_speedtest): add unsigned char cast to avoid
	a blinking character if an 8bit-character is mistyped

2001-08-31  Felix Natter  <fnatter@gmx.net>

	* Makefile.am: add version.sh to EXTRA_DIST

2001-08-30  Felix Natter  <fnatter@gmx.net>

	* configure.in: now configure.in gets the version-number from
	version.sh (as suggested by Michael)

2001-08-23  Felix Natter  <fnatter@gmx.net>

	* gtypist.c (main): change "skip back" to "go back" in
	SKIPBACK_VIA_F_MSG

2001-08-20  Felix Natter  <fnatter@gmx.net>

	* gtypist.c (main, do_query): rename _("YN") to _("Y/N")

2001-08-16  Felix Natter  <fnatter@gmx.net>

	* NEWS: write the list of new/changed features for 2.4
	* gtypist.c (do_on_failure_label_set): allow special value "NULL"
	* gtypist.c (do_speedtest): set errors to 0 in the loop (I forgot
	to do this when I changed do_speedtest to use a repeat-loop)

2001-08-13  Felix Natter  <fnatter@gmx.net>

	* gtypist.c (main, do_query): add new translatable string `YN'
	which is used to translate the keys in Y/N-queries (but Y/N are
	still accepted as well)
	* gtypist.c: replace SPEED_PC_ERR by SPEED_PCT_ERROR (pct is
	the normal abbreviation for percent)
	* gtypist.c: add some comments where _() appear, to help translators
	(recent versions of xgettext put these comments in the po-files)
	* gtypist.c (print_help): in help-string for --error-max, don't
	mention that it can be overridden in the script-file (but that
	is still mentioned in the manual)

2001-08-12  Felix Natter  <fnatter@gmx.net>

	* gtypist.c (do_error_max_set): if --error-max is specified
	(*not* if the default value is used), then an E:-command will
	only be applied if its level is more difficult (smaller) than
	the one specified via --error-max/-e
	* gtypist.c (print_help): add that --error-max is the _default_
	maximum error percentage, and that it can be changed in the
	script-file to some extent
	* gtypist.c (print_help): clean up so that i.e. "-c F,B" fits in
	* gtypist.c (print_rep): replace by indent_to
	* gtypist.c (print_usage_item): only break between words
	* remove parameter cl_drill_tries, add cl_default_error_max and
	adapt do_drill and do_speedtest accordingly
	* gtypist.c (do_query): third parameter for use by
	do_query_noscriptfile, return value: if TRUE means got a
	function-key, if FALSE means Y/N
	* gtypist.c (do_query_noscriptfile): new function used in do_drill/
	do_speedtest
	* english-fixes in comments + use same style
	* add prototypes
	* add WANNA_REPEAT_MSG, ERROR_TOO_HIGH_MSG, SKIPBACK_VIA_F_MSG
	* gtypist.c (do_drill, do_speedtest): add "builtin repeat loop"
	* gtypist.c (print_help): use ';' to separate sentences in help-strings
	* gtypist.c (fatal_error): make the ouput more logical
	* gtypist.c (do_error_max_set): new function which sets --error-max
	* gtypist.c (do_on_failure_label_set): new function whichs set the
	"skipback-on-failure label"
	* gtypist.c (do_drill, do_speedtest): remove O:, rename P: to S:
	and add "practice only" drills d: and s:
	* gtypist.c (do_drill, do_speedtest): allow "give up" via ESC
	(repeat lesson)

2001-07-26  Felix Natter  <fnatter@gmx.net>

	* configure.in: add AM_PATH_LISPDIR which is needed for
	lisp_LISP = gtypist-mode.el

2001-07-24  Felix Natter  <fnatter@gmx.net>

	* gtypist.c (cl_wpmode): should be disabled by default
	* gtypist.c replace all occurrences of addch by ADDCH
	* gtypist.c (ADDCH, ADDCH_REV): add (unsigned char) cast
	which is necessary to display 8 bit characters correctly
	(thanks to Thomas E. Dickey" <dickey@herndon4.his.com> for the hint)

2001-07-21  Felix Natter  <fnatter@gmx.net>

	* gtypist.c (parse_cmdline): simplify command-line parsing by using
	the fourth field of struct option + use '-' to separate words
	in long options
	* gtypist.c: rename cl_nowpmode to cl_wpmode (and change code
	accordingly) because it's now disabled by default

2001-07-21  Felix Natter  <fnatter@gmx.net>

	* gtypist.c (SCR_COMMAND): do not accept lowercase command_char's

2001-07-20  Felix Natter  <fnatter@gmx.net>

	* gtypist.c (index_labels,do_goto): remove trailing whitespace in
	labels

2001-06-11  Christian Weisgerber <naddy@openbsd.org>

        * po/*.po: added a proper charset specification.
          (for current gettext with iconv support)

2001-06-11  Christian Weisgerber <naddy@openbsd.org>

	* po/Makefile.in.in: now correctly uses DESTDIR
	* Makefile.am: removed "CPPFLAGS+=-Wall" to support
	  compilers different from gcc.

2000-12-05  Kester Habermann <kester@linuxtag.de>

        * po/es.po, po/de.po: Added new strings shown with --help and --version

2000-11-10  Vladimir Tamara  <vtamara@gnu.org>

	* typist.c: Changed name to GNU Typist (gtypist)
	* typist.c: Output of --help and --version changed, in order
	  to support help2man (that generates automatically a man page).
	  A new target in the Makefile can do it: typist.1
	* typist.c: Source code fully GNU Coding Standards compliant.

2000-10-23  Caolan McNamara <caolan@csn.ul.ie>

	* typist.c: Now  word processor mode by default is  off, it can be
	  activated  with  the  options   --wpmode  or  -w.   (The  option
	  --nowpmode dissapears)

2000-09-12  Vladimir Tamara  <vtamara@gnu.org>

	* The data of typist by default now is installed at prefix/share/typist

2000-09-09  Vladimir Tamara  <vtamara@gnu.org>

	* Now the keys F1,F2,...,F12 can be "emulated" with
	  1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0,A,S and also C-q, C-w, C-r, C-t, C-z, C-u,

	* configure now stops if the ncurses library is not found

2000-09-05  Vladimir Tamara  <vtamara@gnu.org>
