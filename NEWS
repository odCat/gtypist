    (See the ChangeLog file for details)

    See the manual for details.

  - built with automake-1.6.3 and gettext-0.11.5.

Version 2.6 - April/2002

    (see the new section "Using typefortune" in the manual).

Version 2.5.1 - February/2002
  - fix a bug in --help output
  - small documentation fixes

Version 2.5 - January/2002
  - Allowed the user to skip an exercise or exit the lesson by
    pressing ESC twice (once to restart and then again at the
    beginning of the exercise to skip)
  - Added new switch --no-skip which prohibits the user from skipping
    exercises
  - Removed more occurrences of "Q: Press Y to continue, ..."  following
    an exercise (because this is builtin since 2.4) in d.typ, r.typ, v.typ
    and esp.typ
  - Removed all occurrences of "Q: Press Y to cont..." following T: :
    It doesn't make sense to repeat a T:, the standard message

    (multi-page T:'s are the exception)
  - The last two changes make the lesson-files quite a bit simpler
  - Fixed errors in d.typ and esp.typ (see lessons/ChangeLog)

    and add descriptions in	menus, remove node "Technical Information"
    and place its children on top-level and small markup changes
  - gtypist-mode.el now works with XEmacs as well (because of this,
    gtypist-mode-goto-label is now bound to C-c M-g)

Version 2.4 - September/2001
  - Added Finnish Native Language Support
  - Changes to the types of exercises: d,D for drills and s,S
    for speed-tests
  - Added commands E: (sets error-max) and F: (sets "on failure" label)
    (currently only used in demo.typ and esp.typ)
  - do_drill, do_speedtest: added "builtin repeat loop"
  - print_help: only break on whitespace in help-strings, use ';'
    to separate words.
  - Allowed translation of the "do you want to repeat?" message
    (which is possible because it is now builtin) and the corresponding
    keys (Y/N)
  - fatal_error: made the output more logical
  - Allowed "give up" (repeat lesson) via ESC (there is no way to
    skip an exercise in 2.4)
  - Added (unsigned char) cast in ADDCH, ADDCH_REV to support
    8bit-characters in exercises
  - Rewrote command-line parsing + use '-' as word-separator in
    long options
  - command_char's are case-sensitive now
  - Ignores trailing whitespace in labels
  - Added new lessons which are converted from ktouch-1.0
    (http://ktouch.sourceforge.net)
    kt*.typ, converted by tools/ktouch2typ.pl and
    tipptrainer-0.3.3
    (http://www.pingos.schulnetz.org/tipptrainer):
    currently only the german lesson, which is in ttde.typ, converted
    by tools/tt2typ.pl.

    tools/gtypist-mode.el
  - Improved i18n-support
  - Improved German translation (with help from de@li.org)
  - Minor fixes (build, charset definition)
  - Documentation improvements

Version 2.3.2 - Nov/2000
  - Now this program is part of GNU!  We celebrate with a new
    name: "GNU Typist" (or gtypist) and a new release
  - New documentation in Texinfo format, the man page now is
    generated automatically with the program help2man
  - Now configure  supports curses  if ncurses is  not available
    (thanks to Caolan McNamara <caolan@csn.ul.ie>)

Version 2.3.1 - Sep/2000
  - Fixed bug with --datadir reported by	stephan.hegel@gmx.de
    Installation of data by default now in prefix/share/typist
  - Now the keys F1,F2,...,F12 can be "emulated" with
    1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0,A,S and also C-q, C-w, C-r, C-t, C-z, C-u,
    C-i, C-o, C-p, C-a, C-s
  - Fixed bug in word processor mode reported by Ben Armstrong,
    <synrg@sanctuary.nslug.ns.ca> now  by  default  this mode  is
    off, it  can be  activated with the  option --wpmode  or -w.
    (The option --nowpmode doesn't exist anymore)
  - Better documentation for installing typist with Dvorak keyboards
    and under DOS without Long File Name Support (tested under DOS 6.22)

Version 2.3 - Ago/2000
  - New lesson in spanish (lessons/esp.typ)
  - NLS (Native Language Support) added (via GNU gettext).
  - Avalaible NLS for Spanish (po/es.po) and German (po/de.po)
  - Ported to Windows/DOS with the DJGPP compiler and PDCURSES library
  - New configuration scheme, using automake and autoconf

Version 2.2b:
  - Fixed a bug in exercises, where the typing timer was not started
    when the exercise begins with space characters and word processing
    behaviour is enabled.
  - Moved the binary to typist_bin, and created a typist shell script
    wrapper to try to cope with TYPIST_PATH not set, and the variations
    in the location of the terminfo database between Red Hat 5.2 and
    other platforms.
  - Again, why not look at 'Jtypist'.

Version 2.2a:
  - Added word processing like behaviour to the exercises, so that
    multiple spaces combine into one, return moves to the next
    paragraph, space is accepted at the end of a line, and hyphens
    at a line's end are skipped.
  - Fixed drills so that delete does not actually insert an error,
    but is now just ignored.
  - Corrected backspace key detection on Red Hat GNU/Linux 5.2.

Version 2.2:
  - Removed the C++ version of the program.  Apart from my elderly
    slackware system, this would not really compile anywhere else,
    and was causing more problems than it was worth.
  - Added the "one-time" 'O' drill command.
  - Added the function key to label binding 'K' command, to allow
    better menus to be built.
  - Tidied the C program for better error handling.  It's still a
    bit messy, though.
  - Optimised T/D/O/P commands to avoid "Press return to continue"
    where they are directly followed by a Q command.
  - Updated typv1tov2 and typcombine to use these new features,
    and output improved menus that use the function keys for direct
    access to lessons, and repeat-this-exercise queries.
  - The typist binary is now statically linked for GNU/Linux, to
    try to enhance its portability as a binary.  The build system is
    now Red Hat 5.2, and the program is now an incredible 700kB
    as a static binary.
  - All of these enhancements got finished up after I had completed
    the Java version, 'Jtypist'.  If you can, I'd heartily recommend
    that you use the Java one instead of this package.  It has a
    far better interface, and lots of extra features that Typist 2.2
    doesn't have.  You should be able to obtain a copy of it from
    the same place that you picked up this package from.

Version 2.1a:
  - Whole package GPLified.  Otherwise, no changes.  None.
    Nothing at all.  Really.
